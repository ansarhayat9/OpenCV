# OpenCV Basics - Image Processing with Python

This repository contains a collection of simple and fundamental OpenCV programs designed for beginners who are learning image processing with Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

These scripts demonstrate core OpenCV functionalities such as reading, writing, and manipulating images, performing transformations, and applying different operations like filtering, thresholding, and object detection.

## âœ… Topics Covered

- Reading and Writing Images
- Resizing Images
- Image Blurring (Average, Gaussian, Median)
- Adding Borders to Images
- Rotating and Translating Images
- Image Thresholding Techniques
- Working with Different Color Spaces (RGB, HSV, GRAY)
- Image Denoising
- Inpainting Techniques
- Intensity Transformations
- Edge Detection (Canny, Sobel)
- Arithmetic Operations on Images
- Bitwise Operations on Binary Images
- Drawing Shapes (Lines, Circles, Rectangles, Text, Arrows, Ellipses)
- Feature Detection
  - Circle Detection
  - Line Detection
  - Face and Eye Detection using Haar Cascades
- Playing Video using OpenCV

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
